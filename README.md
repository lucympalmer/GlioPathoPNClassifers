# GlioPathoPNClassifers
Classification by Discriminant Function Analysis and Artificial Neural Networks

The Discriminant Function Analysis classifier (DFAC), Logistic Regression classifier (LRC), and Multi-layer Perceptron classifier (MLPC) were built to test whether the pyramidal neurons neighbour the high- or low-grade glioma, using either their extracted features or recording traces.

Features: DFAC & LRC

Traces: LRC & MLPC
